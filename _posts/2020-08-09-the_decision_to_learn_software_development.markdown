One of my favorite things about meeting other coding students is learning about the multitude of different backgrounds that they're coming from. When I first enrolled in this course, I was sure that my own origin was atypical as I pursued an illustration degree in college for three years. From a layman's perspective, the overlap between the fundamentals of art and the fundamentals of coding maybe not appear immediately obvious. Anyone that does one or the other would be able to tell you that the basic principles of design are the same, as is the work that goes into understanding and practicing such. Anyone can learn to draw with enough time, effort, and dedication: I've realized recently that that holds true for coding as well. 

For most of my life, I thought that learning coding—let alone making a career out of it—was inaccessible. Public perception tends to be that it's something one has to learn in early childhood to truly be able to master and understand it; not that it's ever quite clear *how* it's learned in the first place. My view of that changed when I learned that one of my family members had gone through a coding bootcamp similar to Flatiron. He graduated a few years ago, and he's had multiple different programming jobs since then.

When I was exposed to the fact that coding was a skillset that was actually accessible, I began to consider it as a serious prospect for my future—one that I've now committed myself to.
